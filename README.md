# Frontend Mentor - Four card feature section

[Design preview for the Four card feature section coding challenge](https://pantbibek21.github.io/four-card-feature-section/))

## Welcome! ðŸ‘‹

This is another challege from Frontend Mentor. I am really loving doing these challenges. It is helping me to understand different little things that we often lack to practice. In this challenge I used flex-box to design the layout. 
I was facing problem when I had to make all the column width to reduce proportionally.
But I made that by using
max-width and min-width and also setting flex-grow to 1. 
That was the best part of doing this challenge. 

If you can help me point out my weakness, any better way of practing, that would be great. 
Thank you so much , if you read this far.
